Lab 6-7: networking
- convert your project to a client-server application using sockets
- simulate an RPC server (messages sent between the client and the server must be handled in a unitary manner (simulate RPC calls) )
- the server must be concurrent; use Java 8 language features; threads with ExecutorService
- on the client side, service calls must be non-blocking
- using external libraries for RPC is not allowed; only sockets
- only the db (jdbc) persistence is needed
- SOLID principles and other best practices discussed in the context of the previous project are also applied here
